Dart Engine: Open source generic API protocol with a Node.js implementation for simple API creation.

<h2>Problem</h2>

As a Node.js developer when I need to create a new REST API to access a Data Store I need to go through a process of creating a project, find myself between all the existing packages, choose one, and do a bunch of configurations adhering to the package documentation. This process is very time-consuming and I always end up with a lot of repetitive code.
<h2>Solution</h2>

Thinking that this might be a common problem for other developers I decided to create a generic API protocol for Rest APIs that expose a Data Store and different implementations that will allow me to create such a project in a matter of minutes.
<h2>Specification</h2>
<small>This is a draft version</small>
<br/>
A Dart Engine implementation should be according to the following specification:
<ul>
    <li>
        It consists of an entry file, that describes the API.
    </li>
    <li>
        It generates a REST API that exposes a specfied SQL Data Store.
    </li>
    <li>
        Generated endpoints enable CRUD operations on the Data Store.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is extensible and allows for custom endpoints.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is configurable and allows for customizing the generated API.
    </li>
    <li>
        Deployment is easy and can be done with a single command.
    </li>
    <li>
        Apply security to the generated API.
    </li>
    <li>
        OpenAPI documentation is generated.
    </li>
</ul>
