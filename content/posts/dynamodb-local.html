Amazon DynamoDB is managed, serverless key-value NoSQL database that is quite
popular among AWS users/developers. It is a great choice for applications that
require low latency and flexible data models. When developing applications that
use DynamoDB, it is a good idea to have a local instance of DynamoDB running on
your machine. This will allow you to develop and test your application without
having to connect to the cloud. In this short post, I will share how I set up
DynamoDB for local development and for writing integration tests.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
The only prerequisite is to have Docker installed on your machine.

<h2>Docker Compose</h2>
The easiest way to set up DynamoDB locally in my opinion is to use Docker Compose. And the content 
of the `docker-compose.yml` file is as follows:

{{< highlight yaml>}}
version: '3.8'
services:
 dynamodb-local:
   command: "-jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb -dbPath ./data"
   image: "amazon/dynamodb-local:latest"
   container_name: dynamodb-local
   ports:
     - "8000:8000"
   volumes:
     - "./docker/dynamodb:/home/dynamodblocal/data"
   working_dir: /home/dynamodblocal
{{< /highlight >}}

This will create a container named `dynamodb-local` and expose port `8000` on
your machine using `amazon/dynamodb-local` image.

To start the container, run the following command:

{{< highlight bash>}}
docker-compose up -d
{{< /highlight >}}

And that's it! You now have a local instance of DynamoDB running on your machine.

To test the setup you can use the AWS CLI or write a simple application that
connects to DynamoDB. 

Using the AWS CLI, you can run the following command to list all tables:

{{< highlight bash>}}
aws dynamodb list-tables --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
{{< /highlight >}}

If you want to use a simple NodeJS application to test the connection, you can use the following code:

{{< highlight javascript>}} 
const { DynamoDBClient, ListTablesCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb');
const main = async () => {
  const client = new DynamoDBClient({
    region: 'us-east-1',
    endpoint: 'http://localhost:8000',
  });

  const command = new ListTablesCommand({});
  const response = await client.send(command);
  console.log(response.TableNames);

};
{{< /highlight >}}
I prefer to use the second approach because it gives me more flexibility in terms of accessing 
DynamoDB, and I also can use and modify the code to test different scenarios and doing experiments
before writing the actual code.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In this post, I shared how I set up DynamoDB for local development. I hope you
found it useful. If you're interested in learning more about DynamoDB, I
recommend checking out the official documentation.
